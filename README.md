# jekyll-theme-niveus

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes` and your sass in `_sass`. To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-niveus"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-niveus
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-niveus

## Usage

You should add the class `youtube` to Youtube iframes and `photo` to `img` tags you want to show in your posts.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
